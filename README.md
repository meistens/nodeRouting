# Basic Routing With NodeJs and No Dependencies (The Horror ðŸ˜±)

That aside, this is a task given and done by [The Zuri Team](www.14g.zuriboard.com).

It covers;

- Creating a server and a function to 'listen';
- Routing and rerouting using a switch-case statement;
- Implementing status codes (for some reason, routes and reroutes throws a blank page and illegal on the terminal...);

All with NodeJs (and the rest as seen on the heading).

To run the server, open your terminal, type **node app** and voila!

## Available Routes

Routes availabe are;

- \
- \home (redirect/reroute)
- \about
- \contact

Going beyond specified routes won't get you anything but a depressing 404 page (yeah, would've geeked out on the pages but I suck at web designs...)
