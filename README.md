# Basic Routing With NodeJs and No Dependencies (The Horror ðŸ˜±)

That aside, this is a task given and done by The Zuri Team.

It covers;

- Creating a server and a function for request and response;
- Writing another function to 'listen' for/catch requests made by the server;
- Using the filesystem to select a file to route (using the http module);
- Routing and rerouting using a switch-case statement (if-else statement was confusing to use in this scenario);
- Implementing status codes;
- And bunch of stuff the docs on NodeJs site covers...

To run the server, open your terminal, type **node app**.

If you see a message on your terminal, starting with 'Mein Freund....', it means it works!

## Available Routes

Routes availabe are;

- \
- \home (redirect/reroute)
- \about
- \contact

Going beyond specified routes won't get you anything but a depressing 404 page (yeah, would've geeked out on the pages but I suck at web designs and use a shitty laptop...)
